## Selected Design: Response 1 - Technical Minimalism with Precision

This approach aligns perfectly with the robots.txt validator's purpose as a developer tool. The Swiss Style minimalism provides clarity and focus, while the dark theme with cyan/lime accents creates a professional, technical aesthetic. The monospace typography reinforces the technical nature of the tool, and the asymmetric layout efficiently uses screen space for input and results.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Dark charcoal background (#0f1419)
- Cyan (#00d9ff) and lime (#00ff88) accent colors
- IBM Plex Mono and JetBrains Mono fonts
- Asymmetric two-column layout
- Terminal-style interactions with micro-animations
- High contrast for accessibility
- Grid-based spacing system (8px)
